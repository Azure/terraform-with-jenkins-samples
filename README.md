# Provision & Deprovision Azure VMSS using Terraform and a Jenkins pipeline

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) enables you to safely and predictably provision, change, and improve infrastructure using [plans](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) and [commands](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html). This repo contains Terraform plans & commands for provisioning an [Azure VMSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview) from an image using a Jenkins pipeline.

## Requirements

*The Jenkins pipelines in this repo leverage Kubernetes features such as pods and secrets while providing an elastic slave pool (each build runs in new pods).*

To use Terraform it is required to have Azure Service Principal.<br/>
Create an Azure Service Principal through [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/provision-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fazure-resource-manager%2ftoc.json) or [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-provision-service-principal-portal).

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) on your computer.
2. Install [Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster)
3. Install [Jenkins in Kubernetes](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/jenkins) with [Helm](https://www.helm.sh/) and configure [Tiller RBAC](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#tiller-and-role-based-access-control)
4. Provision a container registry such as [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr) or create an account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

## Contents

1. Build Docker image with Azure CLI and Terraform. This image will be used later in Jenkins pipeline deployed in Kubernetes
2. Deployment
    - Provision Azure VM from Azure Marketplace plan.
    - Provision a VM image plan.
    - Provision VM or VMSS from a VM image.


### 1. Create Docker image with Azure CLI and Terraform. [Dockerfile](/terraform-az/Dockerfile)

- Build
    ```
    docker build -t <containerRegistry>/terraform-az terraform-az
    ```

- Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry
    ```
    docker push <containerRegistry>/terraform-az
    ```

<hr/>

### 2. Deployment - Jenkins Pipeline in Kubernetes
- Provision VMSS from a VM image. 
    1. Create Kubernetes [secret](/jenkins-pipelines/terraform-az-secret.yaml) with Azure Service principal. This is required for the following pipelines.
    2. Setup [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-java-jenkins-continuous-integration-solution) in Jenkins and modify the pipelines accordingly with the relevant id, credentials and container name.
    3. Jenkins Pipeline (Provision) [Jenkinsfile](/jenkins-pipelines/create-vmss-from-image/provision/Jenkinsfile)

    4. Jenkins Pipeline (Deprovision) [Jenkinsfile](/jenkins-pipelines/create-vmss-from-image/deprovision/Jenkinsfile)

    ***The VMSS plan and tfstate are saved in Azure Blob Storage under `plans` and `tfstate` storage containers to support better automation***
